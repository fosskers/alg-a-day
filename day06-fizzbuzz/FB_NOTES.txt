Algorithm-a-Day : Day 06 : FizzBuzz

ABOUT FIZZBUZZ
--------------
  Blogs tell me that this is a test to separate the men from the boys when
it comes to programming. The instant I saw that I knew I had to tackle it,
and so I went and wrote four solutions.
  The idea is to print the numbers 1 to 100, except that for every multiple
of 3 you must print 'Fizz', for every multiple of 5 'Buzz', and for multiples
of both, 'FizzBuzz'.

C
-
  Pretty simple. Taking advantage of the fact here that C requires you to
manually enter your newline characters, you can simply follow your intuition,
asking for multiplicity, then slapping the newline on at the end when you're
done.

PYTHON
------
  Similar to but just barely slimmer than the C version, here we employ 
str.join() to make everything nice and clean. 

HASKELL 1
---------
  Pretty much a one liner with a very ugly map. Not much different from the 
previous two solutions. However...

HASKELL 2
---------
  Oh baby. Here we go backwards. We start off with a list of tuples containing
each number and the String 'FizzBuzz'. We then map through with a shaver
function that strips that string of either Fizz or Buzz if it's not the 
proper multiple. Much nicer to look at!
